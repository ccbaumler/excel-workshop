# Overview

- Excel software
- math and calculations
- basic graph reading

# Excel software

- Basic software usage
- Basic arithmetic
- Basic function use

## Excel an "***easy***" entry point to data analysis

### Basic software usage

What is Excel(pronounced "Eks-sel")?

- Excel (and any spreadsheet program) allows for easy entry of data, analysis, and visualization

- This is proprietary software typically provided by your employer or university

To begin, 

- open Excel on your device

- log into [office.com](https://www.office.com){target="_blank"}

## Excel is overwhelming on first use

### Basic software usage

::: notes
Any new GUI is overwhelming. Take a moment to hover over or click some of the commands to see what they do.
:::

The `ribbon` is a set of `tabs` that are `groups` of `commands` to provide short cuts to the user.

<br></br>
<br></br>

The `sheet` is a `named` spreadsheet containing `cells` that allow input, arithmetic, and functions in the `formula bar`.

## Adding some data into the sheets is easy

### Basic Software Usage

Navigate with `tab`, `enter`, `arrow keys`, `left-clicking`, the `Name Box`

Input new information in selected cell by typing in the cell or the `Formula Bar`

## Add moving, deleting, adding and removing undo and redo

# Basic arithmetic

- Formulas
- Sequences
- Functions

## Arithmatic starts with a formula

### Formulas

formulas start with =
integers, cells 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
parentheses = order of operation

## Quickly creating a sequence is simple

### Sequences

For a constant sequence, 

  - input at least one value in a column
  - click the lower right green box on the cell
  - drag to the desired sequence length

## Quickly creating a sequence is simple

### Basic Software Usage

For a constant sequence, 

::: nonincremental

  - input at least one value in a column
  - click the lower right green box on the cell
  - drag to the desired sequence length

## Quickly creating a sequence is simple

### Basic Software Usage

For a linearly increasing sequence,

  - input at least two increasing integers in a column
  - click the lower right green box on the cell
  - drag to the desired sequence length

## Quickly creating a sequence is simple

### Basic Software Usage

::: notes

(25,50,...)
(2,4,6,...)
(1,3,6,...)
(10,9,8,...)

(Advanced requires function or arithmetic )

(e.g. 25, 50, 100, 200,...)
(25, =A1*2)

(e.g. 1,2,..,1,2)
(1, =A1, =A1+1)
=IF(MOD(ROW(),2)=0,2,MOD(ROW(),2))
if the remainder is equal to 0, return the value 2
    else if the remainder is not equal to 0 return the remainder
    
i.e. 2/2=0 (2 divides 2  1 time with no remainder)
     5/2=2.5 (2 divides 5  2 times with 1 as the remainder)
         Divide a by b to find the remainder.
         5 รท 2 = 2 R1

=IF(MOD(ROW(),3)=0,3,MOD(ROW(),3)) for (1,2,3,1,2,3,...) because 0R1 0R2 0R0 1R1 1R2 2R0

What about:

- A linearly increasing sequence of values greater than 1?
- A sequence of even integers? 
- A sequence of odd integers? 
- A linearly decreasing sequence? 
- A nonlinear, exponential sequence?
- A alternating sequence?
